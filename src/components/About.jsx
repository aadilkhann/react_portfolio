          During my academic journey and personal projects, I have gained hands-on experience in developing responsive and user-friendly web applications using React.js, along with server-side development using Node.js and Express.js. I have also worked with databases, including MySQL and NoSQL, to design efficient data models and implement robust data management systems.

          In addition to web development, I have a keen interest in Android app development. I have successfully built Android applications that provide engaging user experiences and leverage the capabilities of mobile devices. My knowledge of Java and Android SDK allows me to develop feature-rich applications and integrate them with various APIs and services.
